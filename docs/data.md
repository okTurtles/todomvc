# The todos slot and the writes

This is for someone reading `src/chelonia/todos.js` and `lists.js`. The README
says what happens; this shows the code.

Two slots are declared once, at startup. `lists` on the identity contract holds
the IDs of the lists this account is in, and `todos` attaches to each of those
lists:

```js
sbp('chelonia/kv/defineSlot', {
  contractType: 'todomvc/list',
  key: 'todos',
  defaultValue: {},
  schema: todosSchema,
  match: (contractID, contractState) =>
    currentLists().includes(contractID) &&
    !!sbp('chelonia/contract/currentKeyIdByName', contractState, '#sak', true)
})
```

`match` decides which contracts a slot attaches to. The second half of it is
what makes a shared list wait: a list you have just joined is in `lists`, but
until its keys arrive there is nothing you could read or write, because the
server checks the contract's `#sak` before serving `/kv/:contractID/:key`. See
[sharing.md](sharing.md) for how the keys arrive.

Every write is a reducer:

```js
sbp('chelonia/kv/update', {
  contractID,
  key: 'todos',
  updater: (prev) => ({ ...prev, [id]: { title, completed: false, createdDate } })
})
```

No etags, no conflict callback, no per-key event. The server rejects a write
that was based on a stale value, and Chelonia responds by refetching and running
the reducer again on the newer one. That is why two windows converge. Returning
`KV_NOOP` from a reducer cancels the write, which is how toggling a todo that is
already in that state avoids a pointless round trip.

Reading does not go over the network. Chelonia keeps a local copy of every
declared slot at `rootState._kv[contractID][key]` and updates it from four
places: the first load, a push from another client, our own write, and a
refetch after the socket reconnects. That state object is a Vue `reactive()`,
so a `computed` over it reruns on all four and the list redraws by itself.

## Offline

`chelonia/kv/update` needs the server, so while the socket is down a write goes
into Chelonia's persistent action queue instead (`src/chelonia/offline.js`).
The queue stores `[selector, ...args]` as JSON, which is why writes are named
(`'addTodo'`, `'setTitle'`, ...) and the reducer is looked up when the write
runs. The queue lives under one localStorage key, so it survives a reload, and
`retryAll` is called as soon as the socket is back.

Until a write lands, `currentTodos` applies it on top of the mirror value, so
the list looks the same offline as it will once the server has it. When a write
succeeds it is taken off that overlay, on `PERSISTENT_ACTION_SUCCESS`. When the
server refuses a write it is dropped and the list says so, because retrying
would only get the same refusal.

Two things worth knowing about the queue:

- The queue belongs to the browser, not to a window, so every window of the
  same account shares it.
- Logging out cancels every queued write, and they are never sent. It has to:
  the keys that would sign them are discarded with the session. The app warns
  you and asks whether to log out anyway.

Only individual todo items use the offline queue. Operations on a whole list,
creating one, renaming it, or sharing it, all need the server to be online, so
those controls stay disabled until a connection is back.
